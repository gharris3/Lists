      <h1>Scrambled Eggs</h1>
      <p>Eggs are one of my favourite foods.  Here is a
        recipe for delicously rich scrambled eggs.</p>
      <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <u1>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>1tbs butter</li>
        <li>2tbs cream</li>
      </u1>
      <h2>Method</h2>
      <ol>
          <li>Melt butter in a frying pan over medium
            heat</li>
          <li>Gently mix the eggs and cream in a bowl</li>
          <li>Using a spatula fold the eggs from the edge of
            the pan to the center every 20 seconds (as if
            you are making an omelet)</li>
            <li>When the eggs are still moist remove the
              heat (it will continue to cook on the plate
              until served)</li>
          </ol>
